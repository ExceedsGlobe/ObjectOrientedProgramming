Introduction
YOUR ABILITY TO manage your time, as much as any other
practice in your career as an executive, will determine your
success or failure. Time is the one indispensable and irreplaceable
resource of accomplishment. It is your most precious
asset. It cannot be saved, nor can it be recovered once
lost. Everything you have to do requires time, and the better
you use your time, the more you will accomplish, and the
greater will be your rewards.
Time management is essential for maximum health and
personal effectiveness. The degree to which you feel in control
of your time and your life is a major determinant of your
level of inner peace, harmony, and mental well-being. A feeling
of being out of control of your time is the major source
of stress, anxiety, and depression. The better you can organize

and control the critical events of your life, the better you will
feel, moment to moment, the more energy you will have, the
better you will sleep, and the more you will get done.
It is possible for you to gain two productive hours each
working day, or even double your output and your productivity,
by using the ideas and methods taught in this book.
These techniques have proven successful for many thousands
of executives in every field of endeavor, and they will
prove successful for you, too, as long as you have what I call
the four Ds.
The Four Ds of Effectiveness
The first D is desire: You must have an intense, burning
desire to get your time under control and to achieve maximum
effectiveness.
The second D is decisiveness: You must make a clear decision
that you are going to practice good time management
techniques until they become a habit.
The third D stands for determination: You must be willing
to persist in the face of all temptations to the contrary until
you have become an effective time manager. Your desire will
reinforce your determination.
